		/*
		Task1: Body Mass Index or BMI is calculated by kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms 
		and m2 is their height in metres squared. Define the JavaScript function "bmiCalc" in requested syntaxes 
		which gets weight(kg) and height(m) as its input parameters and return the BMI value
		*/

		//1.1)Defining the function using named function declaration: 

		function bmiCalc(weight, height) {
			let ans = 1;
			ans = (weight) / (height * height);
			return ans;
		}


		//1.2)Defining the function using function expression and function keyword:


		const bmiCalcExp = function (weight, height) {
			let ans = 1;
			ans = (weight) / (height * height);
			return ans;
		};

		//1.3)Defining the function using function expression and arrow function:

		const bmiCalcArrow = (weight, height) => {
			let ans = 1;
			ans = (weight) / (height * height);
			return ans;
		};


		//Please make sure only one of the above function definitions should be available when you run the file and the other definitions should be commented out
